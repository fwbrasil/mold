# Versioning #

Mold adheres to Semantic Versioning 2.0.0. If there is a violation of this scheme, report it as a bug. Specifically, if a patch or minor version is released and breaks backward compatibility, that version should be immediately yanked and/or a new version should be immediately released that restores compatibility. Any change that breaks the public API will only be introduced at a major-version release.
